Simple WebSocket benchmark (JavaScript)
-----------------

Instructions:

```
npm install
node server.js
```

In another shell, type:

node client.js
```

You may replace node with another JavaScript runtime such as bun.

If you are using bun, you may use a special-purpose server:

```
bun bunserver.js
```
